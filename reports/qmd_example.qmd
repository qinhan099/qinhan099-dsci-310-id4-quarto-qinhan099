# Aim

This project explores the historical population of horses in Canada between 1906 and 1972 for each province.

# Data

Horse population data were sourced from @horses1 and @horses2.

# Methods

The R programming language (R Core Team, 2019) and the following R packages were used to perform the analysis: **knitr** (@knitr), **tidyverse** (@tidyverse), and **Quarto** (@Allaire_Quarto_2022).  
*Note: this report is adapted from @ttimbers-horses.*

# Results

## Horse Population Trends

```{r fig-horse-pops, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Horse populations for all provinces in Canada from 1906 - 1972.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/horse_pops_plot.png")
```

Figure @fig-horse-pops shows the horse population trends in Canada.

We can see from @fig-horse-pops that Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta have had the highest horse populations in Canada. All provinces have had a decline in horse populations since 1940. This is likely due to the rebound of the Canadian automotive industry after the Great Depression and the Second World War. An interesting follow-up visualization would be car sales per year for each province over the time period visualized above to further support this hypothesis.

Suppose we were interested in looking more closely at the province with the highest spread (in terms of standard deviation) of horse populations. We present the standard deviations in @tbl-horse-sd.

```{r tbl-horse-sd, echo=FALSE}
horses_sd_table <- read_csv("../results/horses_sd.csv")
largest_sd <- horses_sd_table$Province[1]

knitr::kable(horses_sd_table, caption = "Standard deviation of historical (1906-1972) horse populations for each Canadian province.")
```

Table @tbl-horse-sd shows the standard deviation of historical (1906-1972) horse populations for each Canadian province.

Note that we define standard deviation (of a sample) as:

$$s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2}{N-1} }$$

Additionally, note that in @tbl-horse-sd, we consider the sample standard deviation of the number of horses during the same time span as @fig-horse-pops.

```{r fig-largest-sd, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Horse populations for the province with the largest standard deviation.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/horse_pop_plot_largest_sd.png")
```

Figure @fig-largest-sd zooms into the province with the highest standard deviation in horse population.

In @fig-largest-sd, we zoom in and look at the province of `r largest_sd`, which had the largest spread of values in terms of standard deviation.
